A collection of small projects I built during the March-July 2020 bootcamp

1. **AO3-logo-css-grid**: a piece of pixel art made while practicing n-column grid layouts.

2. **Minesweeper**: a simplified Minesweeper where luck is the only savior. There are no indication to logically find and avoid mines, just a field and unmarked, randomly placed mines.

2. **Tic-tac-toe**: a working game of tic-tac-toe

4. **Ultimate tic-tac-toe**: a working game of Ultimate Tic Tac toe, complete with a few checks for edge cases.
